OVERVIEW: 
The Online Food Ordering System aims to develop a streamlined, user-friendly platform enabling customers to order meals from a range of restaurants. This system is intended to fill a gap in the current market by making it easier for users to order food from local and national food establishments without complex processes or unnecessary wait times. 
With the rise of the online food delivery market, this system has a well-defined scope: to provide a real-time, comprehensive, and secure food ordering experience with features for restaurant management, order tracking, and payment processing. The project will involve designing and developing a robust database management system (DBMS) to handle customer, restaurant, and order information efficiently. 

FEATURES:
The Online Food Ordering System will include the following core features and services: 
•	User Registration and Login System: Users will be able to create and log into accounts securely, providing details like name, address, and contact info. The login and registration processes will include basic encryption to ensure data security. Sessions will be managed using cookies or JWT tokens to maintain a secure and consistent user experience. 

•	Menu Management: Restaurants will have access to a dashboard where they can update their menu, set pricing, and manage promotions. Each restaurant can add categories, individual menu items, descriptions, and images. This data will be stored in the DBMS and organized efficiently using indexing for quick retrieval.

•	Search and Filtering: Users can search for restaurants and filter them by cuisine, ratings, or distance. We will program a search function using a basic binary search algorithm to prioritize relevant results based on user preferences and past ordering history.

•	Order Placement and Customization: Users will be able to select items from a restaurant’s menu, customize their orders (e.g., add extra toppings or remove ingredients), and confirm their selection. This service will be supported by a front-end ordering system that communicates with the back-end to retrieve menu options and availability.

•	Real-time Order Tracking: Once an order is placed, users can view the status of their order in real time, with updates for “Preparing,” “Out for Delivery,” and “Delivered” phases. This tracking system will be programmed using server-sent events to ensure instantaneous updates.

•	Payment Integration: The system will integrate with third-party payment gateways to handle transactions securely. This will include encryption for payment details and a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism for added security. 

•	Data Processing and Reporting: The DBMS will store and analyze user orders, enabling insights into popular items and peak ordering times. Data analysis functions will support restaurant managers in decision-making, while backend processing will ensure quick data access and reliability.
